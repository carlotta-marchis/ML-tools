# ML-tools
Additional ML notes which also contains some useful functions.

**Performance of ML algorithms** defines:
- `compare_binary_classification()` which returns a DataFrame with precision, recall and f1_score for each model passed to it;
- `plot_confusion()` which plots the heatmap of the confusion matrix of the test target data and your prediction.

**Function for hyperparameters tuning with GridSearchCV** defines
- `parameters_tuning()` which performs a GridSearchCV over the model and hyperparameters passed to it and returns.
